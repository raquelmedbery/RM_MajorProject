# RM_MajorProject
First major project I did for my GUI Programming class.

An example of what the product file should look like is found under productlist.txt
An example of what the customer file should look like is found under customer.txt

After choosing these two files a window opens with a tab pane of options to choose from.

You can add new customers, order items, view items available to order in a table,
view customer information in a table, view order information in a table.

Depending on what you choose to order and where to ship it will effect the price of the order,
which appears at the bottom of the screen when the order is submitted.

When you close the window it prompts you to first save the new list of customers,
and then to save the list of orders to a file on your computer. 

Known errors: The city needs to not have a space anywhere in it's name
